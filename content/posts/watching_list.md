## Abstract

A collection of talks, lectures, and reads that have affected me greatly
in my professional life.

## The list

* [Extreme SIMD: Optimized Collision Detection in Titanfall ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BIfqfC1i7U) --
  the best demonstration I've seen of how thinking about the hardware of
  a computer can work wonders when developing a novel algorithm
  scheme.

* [Practicl creativity in Game design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyVTxGpEO30) --
  the talk is packed with useful practical tips that can be applied
  to any creative endeavor, not only game design.

* [GDC - Math for Game Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVmb_qp6XRcwzN9l5mcia6Gh3HOgut3bH) --
  a great way to get to know math relevant to game development.

* [Preventing the Collapse of Civilization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSRHeXYDLko) --
  more of a philosophical talk with ideas applicable to everyday
  software development.

* [Designing and Evaluating Reusable Components](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ5_u8Lgvyk) --
  by far the best talk on API design I've ever seen.

* [The most important talk on programming by Jonathan Blow ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS6rCaDSwW8) --
  this a silly little rant on what to value when developing something new.

* [ Object-Oriented Programming is Bad ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM) --
  one of the first videos that told me about the harsh reality of OOP.

* [CppCon 2014: Mike Acton "Data-Oriented Design and C++"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc) --
  a soft introduction to the DoD approach to software development.
  
* [Data-Oriented Design book](https://www.dataorienteddesign.com/dodmain/) --
  the book that finally got me into the DoD mindset

* [Quick code review of OgreNode.cpp by Mike Acton](https://bounceapp.com/116294) --
  closely related to the DoD mindset, an illustration of what a great
  developer should look for when programming something.

* [TheCherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw),
  [Thin Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/@ThinMatrix),
  [Learopengl](https://learnopengl.com/) -- By far the three sources
  that have taught me the most about rendering and graphics
  programming. All of these are OpenGL-centric but the rendering
  concepts are easily applicable to every graphics API

* [Reverse engineering the rendering of The Witcher 3: Index](https://astralcode.blogspot.com/2018/11/reverse-engineering-rendering-of.html) --
  very good analysis of how The Wither 3 does its rendering. This has
  taught me the practical applications of some rendering techniques.

* [GTA V - Graphics Study](https://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/) --
  again, this article is great at exposing you to modern rendering
  techniques and practices.

* [CppWeekly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxHAlbZQNFU2LgEtiqd2Maw) --
  I don't vibe with C++ that much anymore but I am giving credit where
  credit is due. This series is a great way to learn about modern C++
  features and the C++ Standard library.
 
* [CppCon](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon/videos) -- again, giving
  credit where credit is due.
