## Formal CV {#formal-cv}

A PDF of my real [resume](/ox-hugo/cv.pdf).


## My assigned character {#my-assigned-character}

I was born a human and I'm supposed to live on the planet till my body
gives up and it's no longer suitable for sustaining the social
construct that one would call "life"... or at least I am said so. I
reserve my right to have speculations about this whole
"dying"-thing. I popped into existence in the almost ex-soviet
republic of Bulgaria where I've spent a good portion of my development
into a fully-fledged and normally functioning carbon unit. After
almost a fifth of a century there I've decided to change my location
to the vicinity of central Europe. Germany to be more precise. Here I
am currently studying Computer Science at
the
[Karlsruer Institut fÃ¼r Technologie (KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/). I
quite like it here as for now it's the place that allows me to extend
my skill set, knowledge base and general level of awesomeness through
learning about how computers work, how to tell them what you want them
to do and other fun things about the surrounding world.

## Relevant interests of choice {#relevant-interests-of-choice}

{{< notice tip >}}
Read [ Update 1 ]({{< ref "about.md#update-one" >}}) for clarification
on my current standings about me.  {{< /notice >}}

As previously implied, the delusion I've chosen to believe in is that
I'll do CS (Computer Science) related things till the rest of my
conscious earth-life. With the years (I am not that old, just
obnoxious) I've developed an interest in some narrower areas in the
computer world.

1.  A special place in my heard is dedicated to Artificial
    Intelligence. No, not only the Machine Learning parts. The whole
    thing! The things
    in
    [Artifcial Intelligence: A modern approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/). Not
    only the parts that are rough and massive number-crunching by the
    CPU cores but also the parts that are plain old beauty. The parts
    that model the human brain. This quote summarises my views on AI
    nicely.

    I believe that this section deserves a subsection for its own! So,
    over the years I've acquired tastes for:

    -   Computer vision and image processing and evaluation - I've had
        several times to write my own computer vision/image processing
        library in java at the time (but then some horrible events
        happened to my codebase so sorry, can't back this statement
        with code ðŸ˜¥ ).
    -   Machine Learning. Different types
        of [perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron),
        neural networks, regression models, classification models,
        trees, support vector machines, deep networks... etc. Many of
        those I've implemented once for myself and the sake of
        learning and understanding how everything works
    -   Linear Programming - while most people hated the course where
        this thing is learned at UNI, I kinda loved
        it. [Simplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex%5Falgorithm) can
        be quite the gem. Sadly, I am yet to implement it for myself.
    -   Generic Algorithms
    -   Natural Language Processing
    -   Autonomous agents and group behaviors -
        Man,
        [this book (The nature of code)](https://natureofcode.com/)
        blew me away in unimaginable ways. Not exactly AI, but still!
    -   Statistical Inference - Probability theory can also be a
        beautiful thing if you manage to push past the "statistics".

    As much as I loved AI, I only had the opportunity to have the time
    and necessity to learn about all the cool tools that exist in the
    python ecosystem that enable you to make awesome machine learning
    and AI applications. Libraries and tool-kits as _numpy_,
    _SciKit-learn_, _Tensorflow_, _Keras_, _Eward_... etc.

2.  Computer Graphics/Game engine design - as every naive young boy at
    one point in my life I wanted to make games for a
    living. Unfortunately, I was also kinda smart enough to start
    doing something even thou I had no idea what was I doing. The
    first engines that I've "used" were Unity, Unreal Engine 3
    and... Macromedia Studio 8. Myeah, that last one is a thing that
    existed and it's not game engine at all but hell, I was pretty
    much making a flash game on it. Over the years my focus shifted
    and transitioned to programming but my interest in games
    stayed. Thanks to that, at some point I picked up a little OpenGL,
    a little general 2D/3D Rendering and concepts and a good amount of
    making a rudimentary engine that can run a "game". At university,
    I took a course in Computer Graphics where I learned a whole lot
    of other interesting topics such as ray tracing, realistic image
    generation, seep-up structures, colors, and others. As far as I'm
    concerned - I still find everything in the subject incredibly
    exciting.
3.  EMACS! [EMACS](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is
    everything. Emacs is an operating system, lacking a decent text
    editor. At my first job, I saw my supervisor using it and then a
    guy told me not to touch that thing ever. But I did! And I hated
    it! It was so difficult and unintuitive. Then I forced myself to
    use it because every other editor/IDE was a pain to use when
    programming in C++. I spend a good couple of days configuring
    Emacs and... I made it usable. Then I started investing more and
    more and it became second nature. An extension of my hands, if you
    will. And now I am writing this blog with Emacs. Be sure to check
    out my configuration
    file
    [here](https://github.com/palikar/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs.d/myinit.org).
4.  Web Development - it's one of the things where you learn even that
    you don't want. I am not proud of myself with this one but hey, it
    impresses the employers. I have my fair share with AnuglarJS,
    VueJS, Bootstrap, Foundation, JQuery, ExpressJS, and other little
    and big JavaScript libraries. On the back-end side, a have a
    little bit of experience with [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
5.  Some small interests I've picked in recent times
    -   Operating systems in general, Linux in general (Debian for
        life!) - It <span class="underline">really</span> help to know
        what is happening on OS-level when writing c++.
    -   CPU-Design and what happens in the computer of relatively low
        level - a lot of effects that happen on a transistor-ish level
        are exploitable in code, if you know they exist, of course.
    -   Compiler Design - that one course at uni! Compilers are
        technological marvels, lexers and parser are awesome.
    -   Functions optimization, Non-linear optimization, Computational
        linear algebra, Numerical analysis. In my defense being a
        bigger nerd doesn't really hurt your career.
    -   Lambda calculus - a computational model that has a completely
        different way of reasoning about things. I love it. I fund the
        whole idea interesting, "fresh", mind-boggling and.....just
        different and unconventional.

### Update 1 {#update-one}

Since about the end of 2020, I now primarily deal with real-time
computer graphics and game development. There are also some other
major things that have changed in my views on software development and
I like to sum them up here as a soft amendment of my words in the
previous section. In no particular order:

* As I said at the beginning of the section, I now consider myself as
  "rendering engineer" in the context of the "game development
  industry". Rendering has been a long-standing interest of mine and
  around the end of 2020 I got the chance to work in a company where
  this particular passion of mine was reignited. I never thought I
  would be working on computer graphics up that point so I never
  really pursued it by then (I thought I want to stay in Machine
  Learning/AI). Another more personal factor was me stumbling
  across [Jonathan Blow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow)
  and [Casey Muratori](https://caseymuratori.com/) and their ideas
  about performance-oriented good software that does not cause pain
  to the end user (as most software does these days). Now there is no
  doubt in my mind that my path forward includes real-time rendering
  in games

* My interest in game development/game design has developed itself
  into something more than "I think about this sometimes". Now I think
  about these things all of the time and I want to pursue a career in
  game development.

* My views on how software should be developed, what should we expect
  from the final result, and how we should get there have shifted
  somewhat radically. I now much more emphasis on performance and
  overall quality is given to the end user. You can read more about that
  in my [software philosophy]({{< ref "software_philosophy.md" >}})
  post.

* For the most part, I try to be minimalist in my development -- I
  strive to use fewer tools, less software, fewer libraries, and less
  everything. This is again touched upon in
  the [software philosophy]({{< ref "software_philosophy.md" >}})
  post. To sum it up quickly -- in my experience using more (of
  anything, software, technologies, third-party tools, libraries)
  always brings more problems while being unclear whether the problems
  that are solved are actual problems at all. By now my patience for
  dealing with all that complexity is paying off so I've decided to
  put conscious effort into removing dependencies on complexity in my
  software live.

* I now put MUCH less emphasis on Emacs. As with most of the other
  software, Emacs has its flaws and I would gladly trade it for
  something that gives me the features that I want while having good
  performance (unlike Emacs). And no, I do not want to touch Visual
  Studio Code.

- Took part in a research-oriented practical course at my
  University. The goal was to write a research paper and publish it in
  two semesters. My work was dealing with the application of neural
  networks in the context of numerical simulations.

-   My Bachelor thesis had to do with Machine Learning, stochastic
    probability models (Bayesian Neural Networks and Mixture of
    Gaussian Process Experts) and data from pollution sensors. One of
    my supervisors currently working
    in [HITS](https://www.h-its.org/en/).

-   At Uni I took a Practical Course in Computational Geometry about
    drawing curves (with BSplines) in the plane, doing tricks with
    them (finding a parallel curve, creating a closed curve,
    interpolating curve) and extending those to surfaces(tensor
    product surfaces)

-   A practical course in software development - I and five other
    students, developing a Software product (a Web App) following the
    waterfall methodology (waterfall can be the better choice when you
    are new to everything)

-   Algorithms Teaching assistant in [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) -
    teaching basic data structures, algorithms for sorting, graphs and
    spanning trees, complexity, algorithm analysis, and algorithm
    engineering. Also, again, checking homework.

-   Linear Algebra Teaching assistant in [KIT](https://www.kit.edu/) -
    teaching a bunch of people about basic mathematical notation,
    group theory, rings, bodies, vector spaces, and some other
    things. Also checking the homework of said people.
